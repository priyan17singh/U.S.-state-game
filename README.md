# 🗺️ U.S. State Game (Python Turtle + Pandas)

This is an interactive **U.S. States Guessing Game** built using **Python**, **Turtle**, and **Pandas**. The player is shown a blank map of the United States and is asked to guess the names of all 50 U.S. states. When a correct guess is made, the state's name appears at the correct location on the map.
